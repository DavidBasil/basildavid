<p>Every web application needs a database for the data storage. Rails makes the process of data management very easy and intuitive.</p>

<p>Let's generate a model for our blog application.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">rails g model Article title:string text:text</code></pre>
<p>With this line of code rails generates a database table called "articles" with the columns of title and text.</p>
<p>Now we need to run migration to apply all of this stuff to the database of our choice.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">rails db:migrate</code></pre>

<p>The last thing to do is to modify "routes.rb". We put the this code into it:</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">
resources :articles
</code></pre>

<p>"Resource" is a Rails term for a collection of items, such as articles. When we define a resource for our routes, Rails automatically provides us with a full "CRUD" functionality for create, read, update and delete actions.</p>
