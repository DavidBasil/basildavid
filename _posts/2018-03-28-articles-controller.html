<p>Rails model is useless without a corresponding controller. We need controllers to connect the database with the views and perform "CRUD" actions.</p>

<p>Make sure you're in the right directory and type in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>rails g controller Articles</code></pre>

<p>Rails has just generated an Articles controller with corresponding css and coffeescript files. Rails is really smart!</p>

<p>Ruby on rails has its own conventions and thoughts about performing the standard "CRUD" actions. Open the newly created Articles controller file ()</p>

<ul>
  <li>index</li>
	<li>show</li>
	<li>new</li>
	<li>edit</li>
	<li>create</li>
	<li>update</li>
	<li>destroy</li>
</ul>

<p>With actions a controller is pretty much useless. Rails philosophy insists on having a seven actions for the "CRUD" functionality. Let's start with the first one: new.</p>
<p>Open "app/controllers/application_controller.rb" file and create a new function called "new":</p> 

<pre><code class="ruby">
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def new
  end
end
</code></pre>
