In this tutorial we don't touch database queries. If you need to have a look at them go to <a href="">django database queries.</a>

In this part of the tutorial we'll focus on views. Our blog will need a list and detail view. Django view receives http request and responds appropriately.

List of posts, edit views.py
import render and get_object_or_404
Python function post_list, get all posts from database, render template and context.

Single post view:
def post_detail: takes year, month, day and post as arguments
we use get_object_or_404 method to retrieve the desired post; it launches 404 not found error if can't find that specific post.
use render 

Create urls.py in blog folder
import url and views
first pattern mapps to post_list function, second one to post_detail, it takes arguments need for the post_detail view to look up for the specific post.

Add blog's urls to the main urls.py
