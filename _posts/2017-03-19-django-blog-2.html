  Now we need to somehow add and edit blog posts, right? Django comes wih a ready-to-use administrator dashboard which is very useful when dealing with a lot of content.
</p>

<p>The first step is to create a superuser; superuser the same as an administrator. In your terminal run:
<pre><code class="bash">pytkhon manage.py createsuperuser</code></pre>
I input admin as username, my personal email and let our password be "Password123". That's it, we created the superuser so we can user the admin site for content management.
</p>

<p>Start the server and append our website's link with "/admin"; tha't the address of our admin site. Put in superuser's credentials and you'll be welcomed by admin's dashboard. There you can see "Groups" and "Users" models but there is no Post option. That's because admin site is not aware of the Post model yet so we need to do it manually.</p>

<p>Open "admin.py" of the blog app and insert the following code:
<pre><code class="python">
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
</code></pre>
"admin.site.register" line does what is says: it makes Post model available for our manipulation.
</p>

<p>Refresh the page and Post model will appear in our admin interface.</p>

<p>Let's add some generic posts. Click on the Posts link and fill out the form. Call the first post "Our first post", insert "our-first-post" into the slug field and populate body field with some lorem ipsum text. Click "save" and we'll be redirected to the page listing all our blog posts.</p>

<p>Let's create two additional posts so we have some data to work with. Give them the title of  "How to lose weight" and "10 tricks to gain muscles". Now proceed to the "views" part of our project.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we don't touch on database querying. The subject is pretty extensive and should given whole own series</p>
