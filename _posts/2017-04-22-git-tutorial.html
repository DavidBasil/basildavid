<p>Version control is a very important feature that should be used with every programming project, even if it is a single file. What it does it allows a programmer to go back to the previously saved project states. For example you made some changes to the application files but for whatever reason you did not like them and now you want to revert all those changes. Without version control you'd have to manually undo all your work which can be frustrating and cumbersome most of the time. On the other hand, when using version control system like git you can return the desired state of your project that was saved before.</p>

<p>Git is the most popular version control system. It is easy to use, fast and works very well with large projects when many developers are actively engaged in the development process. This tutorial covers git usage on Linux machine but in case you use any other operating system you can google tutorials on how to install git on your particular setup. Other than that git commands are the same in any environment.</p>

<p id="install">To install git run:
<pre><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install git
</code></pre>
(Small remark: git usually comes preinstalled with Ubuntu.)
</p>

<p>After we have installed git we need to make small changes to configuration. Git requires username and email of the user which makes changes to the project. The following commands are going to set the required settings:
<pre><code class="bash">git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
</code></pre>
Thats it, we are ready to go.
</p>

<hr />

<p>Now create a very simple project so we can get familiar with git basics. Make a new directory called "git_tut" and a file name "tut.py". A little tip: always use virtual environment when working with python. </p>

<p>Put some code into the "tut.py" file, for example:
<pre><code class="python">print('hi there')
</code></pre>
</p>
<p id="repo">
Now that we have some files to work with we need to initialize git repository, in other words tell git to track files in this directory. Make sure you are in "git_tut" folder and run:
<pre><code class="python">git init
</code></pre>
Terminal will inform us that git repository has been initialzed in our directory. Git created a hidden folder ".git". We don't need to touch it but if you want the git to stop tracking the project for some reason you can delete this folder at any time.
</p>

<p id="addcommit">When working on the project we often need to check that status of our work. You can do so by running:
<pre><code class="bash">git status
</code></pre>
At this point git tells us that we have untracked files: "tut.py" and "venv/". Since we don't need git to track virtual enrionment folder we need to warn git to not track that particular folder. Create a file named ".gitignore" and put "venv/" into it. Thats it. When we run "git status" again, venv folder is no longer in untracked files list.
</p>

<p>As we see there are files that git does not track yet. So we need to tell git start tracing them. Run:
<pre><code class="bash">git add .
</code></pre>
The dot at the end of the line means "current directory"; this comand will tell git to start tracking all files and folders in the current directory. Check the status again. Git tells us that there are some changes in our project and we can make a commit, in other words save them. Commit by issuing the following command:
<pre><code class="bash">git commit -m 'initial commit'
</code></pre>
We haved saved the changes; check the status again and you will see that there is nothing to commit. Great!
</p>

<hr />

<p id="log">Thats all cool, but how do we see the logs? We can view all commits with:
<pre><code class="bash">git log
</code></pre>
Git generates a unique reference ID for each commit. "git log" command also displays the author and time of  the commit. We can simplify the log output with:
<pre><code class="bash">git log --pretty=oneline
</code></pre>
The last command also displays the commit message together with the commit ID.
</p>

<hr />

<p>Make a change to our "tut.py" file:
<pre><code class="python">print('hi there!')
name = 'David'
</code></pre>
Run "git status" command and you will see that git notices a change in the file. Since we have all those files added to git repository we can go straight to commit message:
<pre><code class="bash">git commit -am 'add name variable'
</code></pre>
"-am" flag tells git to add modified files and make a new commit with the message. If, however, we created new files in our project we would run "git add ." and then commit the files together the message.
</p>

<p>Check the status and logs again. Now we have two entries in our log journal.</p>

<hr />

<p id="prevcommit">Now lets imagine that we made some mistake while working on our files and now our web app does not work as intended. Thats where the real power of version control comes in. Instead of manually deleting unwanted lines we let the git revert projects to the state how it was during the last commit. Edit "tut.py":
<pre> <code class="python">print('hi there')
name = 'David'

print('oops, I made a mistake')
</code></pre>
We made a mistake and want discard all changes that were made since our last commit. Type this magic words into the terminal:
<pre><code class="bash">git checkout .
</code></pre>
What this command does is it returns all the files in our project folder to the previous state. It may seem insignificant in our case but when working with hundreds of files and collaborating with several developers this feature has tremendous importance and can save you from a lot of headaches.
</p>

<hr />

<p>Ok we just learnt how to go back to the previous commits but what about other earlier commits? First check all logs that we have with "git log" command, pick the commit that you like, lets say we want to go back when we first made our first commit. Now type "git reset --hard" and first six characters of commit ID:
<pre><code class="bash">git reset --hard a8f202
</code></pre>
(Remark: your commit ID will have different characters). Thats it. Now our whole project is exactly at the state where it was during the first commit. Run "git log" - we are at the commit we wanted to start over from.
</p>

<hr />

<p>And lastly if you need to get rid of the git version control from your project just delete ".git" folder from the project directory. That's it.</p>
