<p>I am the type of guy that does not settle with the first tool that was handed to him. I have tried many different gui programs, terminals, languages, frameworks, etc. In this blog post I want to share with readers what I use everyday for my work and I will try give some tips for productivity. I know that those advices might not work for everyone but I still will tell what works in my case.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="system"><strong>Operating System - Linux</strong></h4>
<p>I was raised with Windows and basically I learnt coding on this system. There is nothing wrong with using Windows for web/software development but there is a better tool which is better suited for that particular work: Linux. After I switched to Ubuntu I realized that 95% of the time I spent either in the terminal, chrome or code editor. So switching between operating system was not painful for me at all. If you are serious about programming you will feel more comfortable with Linux.</p>

<h4 id="terminal"><strong>Terminal - Tilix</strong></h4>
<p>I've tried pretty much every terminal that is available for Linux and settled down with Tilix. It allows me split the screen into multiple windows with one small key press. Yes there is Tmux and other tools but I wanted something simple and Tilix is perfect for me.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="language"><strong>Programming Language - Python</strong></h4>
<p>The anwser is simple. I've tried PHP, Javascript, Node.js and even played with Ruby at some point but as soon as I saw Python code I was hooked. I was amazed how clean and simple Python's syntax was. After only two days of going through basics I could look at any Python script I understand what was going on. After you learn Python you immediately realize how ugly and badly designed other languages are (cough, PHP, cough).</p>

<h4 id="framework"><strong>Web Framework - Django</strong></h4>
<p>Logically, if I use Python I must utilize one of its frameworks. And my favorite one is Django. Yes, there is Flask but it is more low level framework good for small projects when you don't need much stucture. Django, on the other hand, is great for large and complex web applications thanks for its clean design and organization philosophy. It's amazing how fast one can build web apps with this framework.</p>

<h4 id="database"><strong>Database - Postgres</strong></h4>
<p>Just because Python programmers prefer it to MySql, nothing personal here. I don't use any gui client for database management because I have not find a perfect one yet so I stick to psql utility on terminal.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="editor"><strong>Code Editor - Vim</strong></h4>
<p>My first code editor (I don't know why many people call them text editors) was Notepad++. It was free, fast and had everything a beginer would need. Its design, however, was far from Hollywood standards so I went for a search for something better. Atom and Brackets were slow, IDE's were ugly and sluggish. Finally I settled down with Sublime Text: it's fast, pretty and has tons of plugins for anything. Then the time came when I started to look into more back-end stuff and that's were terminal came into play. I started spending a lot of time with command line and then I learnt about vim. Vim is a terminal based editor that is installed pretty much on any linux web server so that was a big plus for me. But the main reason why I use vim is for the speed of coding. With vim you don't use mouse at all and you do all your navigation and editing with the keyboard. By the way, learning vim took me only two days and the majority of that time I spent tweaking my "vimrc" file. So if you are good at typing (touch typing) then vim is going to be easy for you. The majority of the time you are going to spend twicking settings and plugins to make vim work like other editors; at least that was my experience.</p>

<h4 id="browser"><strong>Web Browser - Chrome</strong></h4>
<p>Nothing to say here. Chrome is fast, developer friendly and has tons of extensions. Here is the list of some of my chrome extensions:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en">Vimium </a>- gives chrome vim keybindings.</li>
	<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en">Dark reader </a>- enables dark mode so reading text is easier on the eyes.</li>
	<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en">ColorPick Eyedropper </a>- very useful if you work with colors.</li>
	<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cssviewer/ggfgijbpiheegefliciemofobhmofgce?hl=en">CSS Viewer </a>- pretty handy if you need to quickly examine the css code of the current page.</li>
	<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wappalyzer/gppongmhjkpfnbhagpmjfkannfbllamg?hl=en">Wappalyzer</a>- very interesting extension, shows you what web technologies have been used for the website that you are surfing at the moment.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4 id="frontend"> <strong>Front End - html, css, bootstrap, sass</strong></h4>
<p>Nothing fancy here, good old HTML + CSS and Bootstrap. I ocassionaly use Sass but I think it's usability really shines only on really big projects. By the way I use Node to compile Sass.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="productivity"><strong>Productivity Tips</strong></h4>
<p>I know that everybody is different and what works for me may not work for anyone else but here are some things that I do to increase productivity:
<ul>
	<li>Sleep - most important thing, without 9 hours of sleep I'm useless. Some may need 9 hours, some can pull of 5 hours. You have to figure out how much is enough for you.</li>
	<li>Caffeine - I drink a cup of coffee (two tea spoons for each cup) without sugar every 2 hours. And I always add a spoon of butter to every cup to slow down the caffeine absorption.</li>
	<li>I don't eat till my working day is done. But I chew on a piece of fruit before my morning coffee because coffee is bad on empty stomach. This is the best technique that I use for productivity. After I've eaten something especially if it is something with wheat, my energy levels drop down to the floor. So if you want energy and alertness - stop eating!</li>
	<li>I use slightly modified version of Pomodoro techinique - work for 30 minutes then rest for 5 minutes; 20 min break every 2 hours. My average pomodoro number is 8 per day (4 hours). I read somewhere that 4 focused hours per day is a pretty good limit. Using this technique will skyrocket your work rate, trust me.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4 id="books">List of programming books that I've read:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><mark>"Django Unleashed"</mark> by Andew Pinkham - Django encyclopedia, go for it if you don't get bored by a cupious amount of theory. This book taught me ins and outs of the Django framework.</li>
	<br />
	<li><mark>"Django by Example"</mark> by Antonio Mele - amazing book, teaches how to build real world applications, containers very small amount of theory.</li>
	<br />
	<li><mark>"Python Crash Course: A Hands-on, Project-based Introduction to Programming"</mark> by Eric Matthes - a must-have if you want to mess with Python.</li>
	<br />
	<li><mark>"Learning Web Design"</mark> by Jennifer Niederst Robbins - old but this is the best book if you want to learn HTML + CSS.</li>
	<br />	
	<li><mark>"HTML and CSS"</mark> by Jon Duckett - not as deep as "Learning Web Design" but looks very nice sitting on your desk.</li>
	<br />
	<li><mark>"JavaScript and JQuery"</mark> by Jon Duckett - great book but if you want to learn about ES6 then you need something more fresh. Technology moves so fast!</li>
	<br />	
	<li><mark>"JavaScript & jQuery: The Missing Manual"</mark> by David Sawyer McFarland - one the best books I've ever read, a must-have if you want to work with JS.</li>
	<br />	
	<li><mark>"Learning Responsive Web Design"</mark> by Clarissa Peterson - not a lot of practical examples but a good addition to the library if you goal is to be a professional web designer.</li>
	<li>Currently reading: <mark>"Two Scoops of Django"</mark>  - this is not a Django tutorial textbook but more of a collection of best practices shared by experienced developers.</li>
</ul>
