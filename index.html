	<p>Hi there, my name is David Basil and I'm a Ruby on Rails developer.</p>
	<p>I love to read, reasearch and think about Rails.</p>
	<p>I choose Rails because of the speed of development it provides, amazing gems and "full-package" philosophy.</p>
	<p>Tools I like to use besides Rails:</p>
	<ul class="uk-list">
	  <li><span class="uk-text-primary">HTML</span>: erb</li>
		<li><span class="uk-text-success">CSS</span>: sass and uikit</li>
		<li><span class="uk-text-warning">JS</span>: coffeescript with JQuery</li>
		<li><span class="uk-text-danger">SQL</span>: Postgres</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I've written a lot of Django, Angularjs and Nodejs in the past but I prefer to stick to Rails now. Its awesome</p>
	<p>I keep a blog and have a youtube channel, mainly teaching and talking about this awesome framework.</p>
	<p>My goal: to be a number 1 Ruby on Rails expert in the world.</p>
